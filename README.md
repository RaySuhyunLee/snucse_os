# os-team20 Project 3 : Weighted Round-Robin(WRR) Scheduler

## 1. Registering WRR in core.c
Initial scheduler has two policies, Real Time Scheduler and Fair Scheduler(cfs). We inserted a new scheduler: Weighted Round Robin.
Our scheduler basically follows T.A's policy.

## High-Level Design & Implementation
currently developing...

## Lessons Learned
* Most build errors are your eye problems. Read error messages carefully!
* Reading 20k lines of code is nothing. Implementing or fixing it is A THING.
* You can (kind of) program Object Oriented in C. It's terribly gourgeous.
* Pair programming can be a powerful solution when nobody knows what to do.
* There is no "End" in kernel development. In other words, we won't go home in constant time.
